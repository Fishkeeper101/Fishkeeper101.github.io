		<p class="lessonDescription"> Training your dog to sit and stay is one of the most critical skills you can teach them. This skill will be built upon in future lessons- making sure your puppy has stellar grasp of this is important. </p>
		<p class="lessonDescription">You'll have to have already trained the following: </p>
		<ul>
		<li> Clicker or Treat Cue</li>
		<li> Your dog's name</li>
		</ul>

			Step 1: Choose a Quiet Spot with No Distractions
		</summary>

		<div class="stepContent">
		
		<div class="stepDescription">
			<p>It's important to make sure that when you're first training your dog that they are in a spot with as FEW distractions as possible - you want to make sure their focus is on you, not the toy across the room.</p>          

			<p> If there are toys or food in the room, you risk the puppy rewarding themselves, which can reinforce the wrong behavior.</p>          
      		
			<p class="warning">
			<span class="material-icons">warning</span>
				It's really easy in this phase to accidentally reinforce something you don't want to so be aware of what's around.</p>

			Step 2: Wait for them to sit on their own.

			<div class="stepDescription">
				<p>
					Look, this is going to be frustrating, but your puppy will sit eventually. They get tired. When they do, you need to mark it with a your Treat Cue/Clicker, and say the word sit.</p>                  
      		
				<p class="important">
					Don't force your pup to sit down - they won't like that, and it doesn't teach them to do it on their own. You don't want to have to push their butt to make them sit down every time.</p>

			Step 3: Associating Sit with the Action
		</summary>

		<div class="stepContent">
		
		<div class="stepDescription">
			<p>After a few rounds, your puppy will likely begin to understand that "sit" means you want them to sit down. Begin to pre-emptively say "sit" as your pupply looks like they are beginning to sit down. Soon, your puppy will understand when you want them to sit, you'll say sit. When you've reached this point, you've assigned this action to the cue.</p>          
			<p> This may be a good time for a break, but you know your puppy. Always make sure to take a break on a good note- that is, give them a jackpot reward to end training, and make sure you're not ending frusterated.</p>
			<p> Tip: You can also assign a hand signal at this point using the same process, however, don't exclusively use the hand signal until your puppy is sitting reliably.</p>
